  	</h2>
  	<p>
    	Ocean pollution is a problem that plagues many nations across the world. It not only infects the environment, but it also infects our foods and our ways of life.  
For example, microplastics can make their way into fishes bellies, and then make their way into yours

        <p>
    	On a global scale, the most infamous example of large scale plastic pollution is the great pacific garbage patch.   
It's a patch of garbage that spans 1.6 million square kilometers! Around twice the size of Texas. You could give each human around 100 meters squared of land and you could still fit all of them within Texas.

        <p>
    	According to Blaecher from salon.com, 60% of fishes that they examined from all around the world contained microplastics. This means that if you or anyone in your family eat fish regularly, you may be also consuming microplastics with the fish.
